/**
 * main- This program will assign a random number

 * Complete the source code in order to
 * print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
 * You can find the source code here
 * The variable n will store a different
 * value every time you run this program
 * You donâ€™t have to understand what rand,
 * srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
 * The output of the program should be:
 * The string Last digit of, followed by
 * n, followed by
 * the string is, followed by
 * if the last digit of n is greater than
 * 5: the string and is greater than 5
 * if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
 * if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not
 * 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
 * followed by a new line
